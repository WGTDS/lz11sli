    LZ11 SLI

    This code builds upon the SLI algorithm by Nintendo with another
    one of their technologies used in the Wii SDK ["Revolution"].
    The technology in question is an extended extension based on the
    Lempel-Ziv family of compression algorithms, called "LZ77 Extended"
    in this particular instance.
    The goal here is to deliver a better compression ratio using the
    SLI algorithm over the one used in the Wii SDK tool "ntcompress.exe".
    However, this has not been tested in an official capacity, and should
    be treated as an experimental tool.

  return (u32)(((u32)_swap16((u16)( data & 0x0000FFFF)) << 16) |
